"""The claim ledger, and the rule that a claim has to be runnable.

The promise at the top of the README is that nothing in this project is asserted without
either an experiment or a citation. That is easy to write and easy to drift away from,
because the sentence that quietly becomes untrue is never the one anybody was watching. It
is a pass count that was right on the version it was written against, or a "GCC does X"
that was true of the build the author happened to have on their laptop.

So a lesson marks its behavioural claims as it makes them:

    lesson.md(f'''
    {lesson.claim("at -O2 the loop in l1.c is gone by the time tree-optimized runs")},
    which is why the dump has five blocks going in and two coming out.
    ''')

`claim` returns the sentence unchanged, so it reads exactly as it would have without the
call and the reader sees no difference. What it adds is a record, and a rule the build
enforces:

**A claim's evidence is the next code cell, and that cell has to come before the next
section heading.** Proving it three sections later is not proving it, because nobody
reading the paragraph will find the cell. Having no cell at all is the case this is really
for.

Some true things about GCC cannot be observed from a notebook. What `cc1` does with a
freed pass-local obstack, the fact that the gimplifier is one big switch, anything that
needs a debugger on a compiler built with `--enable-checking`. A claim like that is marked
with the reason it cannot be shown, and those are capped per lesson, because without a cap
the escape hatch is the whole game and this turns back into a book with footnotes.

The ledger is generated into `lessons/CLAIMS.md` and committed, the same way the notebooks
are, so it can be read without running anything.

Every behavioural claim the lessons make about GCC, and the cell that proves it.

The rule is that the evidence is the next code cell and it has to come before the next section heading, because a claim proved three sections later is a claim nobody checked.

A few true things cannot be shown from a notebook at all: what a pass does to memory it has already freed, or the shape of a function a reader would need a debugger on `cc1` to see. Those are marked with the reason, and a lesson is allowed at most {cap} of them. The cap is the point. Without it the exception becomes the rule and this goes back to being a book.

Claims about GCC's source rather than its behaviour do not live here. Those carry a `path:line@tag` citation and are checked by `refcheck` against the pinned tree.
